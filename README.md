# DCIT202 Assignment 3

This project is based on creating an UI for an app that focuses on organization, and also provides a list of the ongoing tasks. It also has a search component that allows you to search for items.

The category section was implemented with ScrollView and the ongoing task section was implemented with FlatList to demonstrate how dynamic React is.
